To do:
-----
  Provide help from within workarea pager.

  Do better error diagnostics.

  Make spawned processes inherit options from current one

  Provide for 2-display lists/viewports.

  Correct apollo message about trying to open nil-files
  (they are not directories!)

  Use SHELL environment variable & bldargs() so we needn't
  go thru 'system()' call (which always goes thru /bin/sh).

  Integrate 'padedit()' error messages with 'ded'.

	Add a logfile/script facility to try to flush out bugs in ftree.

88/05/03:
	ft_insert does not check for apollo links such as /usr/lib mapping
	to /bsd4.2/usr/lib, since only the /usr part is a link.  This causes
	confusion also in the F,B,E commands.  If I make 'abspath()' translate
	all pathnames via the name_$get_path, this solves that problem at
	the expense of two others: links are resolved, and the code runs
	slower.

88/05/06:
	Repeat count on search (e.g., "/") commands?

	Gould: does not use newer convention for daylight-savings time.

88/05/10:
	There is a hole: if I resize in ftree, the unsavewin() may
	not work correctly, since we will be restoring to a different size.

	The top_argv checking in 'dedring' does not take into account invocation
	with a wildcard.

88/05/11:
	Running under 'xterm' on Apollo, the first use of '+' puts the
	highlighting in the wrong place.

	Eric has a copy of curses under ~marshall/src/wm/libcurses
	on the Gould.

	Should provide a rename-leaf command in ftree using '='

	The 'E' command from directory-tree spits out a nasty message if the
	tree is out of date...

88/05/16:
	Should do better margin trimming in 'ft_show' and 'ded2s()'.

	Don't think that csh-like symbolic links are processed correctly
	(e.g., "~/src").  Probably should modify linkstat (and corresponding
	inline code in ftree) to do a readlink/abspath/stat (on apollo at
	least).

	The 'h' and backspace command in ftree should not be sticky with
	level.

	Apollo routine c_$map_to_unix may simplify the hack I made in
	abspath.

88/05/25:
	Encountered bug (maybe apollo system) which caused vsize-call in
	'resizewin()' to get strange values after toggling +/- commands
	several times, then invoking 'w'.

	Should show file-locking state from rcslast/sccslast.

88/05/26:
	Should add an 'o'/'O' command to create new files in the list so we
	don't have to do a rescan to get them.

88/06/02:
	np1-port, found that 'putchar()' usage in blip, beep causes warning
	about comparison with an unsigned.

88/06/06:
	should move Xbase, Ybase to common so we can restore screen properly
	when F/B scrolling.

88/06/10:
	should escape '[' in system-commands.

	for chmod, chown, chgrp, should ensure that item is not a symbolic
	link.

	should have a toggle showing ownership of targets of symbolic link.
	show link actual in uppercase; note that this requires making restat
	to do the switch.

88/06/13:
	sometimes the '@' state in ftree is not cleared when we re-read and
	it should now be a directory instead of a link.
