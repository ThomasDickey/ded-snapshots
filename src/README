--------
	ftree should use fixname to show names in case they contain nongraphic
	characters.

To do:
-----
  Provide help from within workarea pager.

  Do better error diagnostics.

  Make spawned processes inherit options from current one

  Provide for 2-display lists/viewports.

  Correct apollo message about trying to open nil-files
  (they are not directories!)

  Use SHELL environment variable & bldargs() so we needn't
  go thru 'system()' call (which always goes thru /bin/sh).

  Integrate 'padedit()' error messages with 'ded'.

	Add a logfile/script facility to try to flush out bugs in ftree.

88/05/03:
	Replace stralloc with txtalloc, don't use strfree.

	ft_insert does not check for apollo links such as /usr/lib mapping
	to /bsd4.2/usr/lib, since only the /usr part is a link.  This causes
	confusion also in the F,B,E commands.  If I make 'abspath()' translate
	all pathnames via the name_$get_path, this solves that problem at
	the expense of two others: links are resolved, and the code runs
	slower.

88/05/06:
	Repeat count on search (e.g., "/") commands?

	Extra mode in ftree which prevents us from finding inVisible items?

	Gould: does not use newer convention for daylight-savings time.
