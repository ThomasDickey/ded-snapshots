To do:
-----
  Use SHELL environment variable & bldargs() so we needn't
  go thru 'system()' call (which always goes thru /bin/sh).

88/05/03:
	ft_insert does not check for apollo links such as /usr/lib mapping
	to /bsd4.2/usr/lib, since only the /usr part is a link.  This causes
	confusion also in the F,B,E commands.  If I make 'abspath()' translate
	all pathnames via the name_$get_path, this solves that problem at
	the expense of two others: links are resolved, and the code runs
	slower.

88/05/06:
	Repeat count on search (e.g., "/") commands?

88/05/10:
	There is a hole: if I resize in ftree, the unsavewin() may
	not work correctly, since we will be restoring to a different size.

	The top_argv checking in 'dedring' does not take into account invocation
	with a wildcard.

88/05/11:
	Should provide a rename-leaf command in ftree using '='

88/05/16:
	Don't think that csh-like symbolic links are processed correctly
	(e.g., "~/src").  Probably should modify linkstat (and corresponding
	inline code in ftree) to do a readlink/abspath/stat (on apollo at
	least).

88/05/25:
	Encountered bug (maybe apollo system) which caused vsize-call in
	'resizewin()' to get strange values after toggling +/- commands
	several times, then invoking 'w'.

88/06/27:
	Should redo the ftree-rename so it renames the ring-entries too.

88/08/09:
	'beep()' and 'blip()' write to stderr, which is not necessarily good.
	Should try to use 'curses' internal routine to send characters.
	I saw beep clobber an escape sequence on the gould.

88/08/16:
	Also, sometimes the 'R' does not properly quit from the existing
	ring entry when no files are found.

88/09/1:
	For SYSTEM5, should use 'wrefresh(curscr)' to forcibly refresh the
	screen.

88/09/06:
	Consider another toggle in ftree to suppress names beginning with
	'.' (e.g., 'A' or '.').

	In '>' command (also, '=') don't try to perform change if none
	occurred!

88/09/08:
	should add sort-by-leafname (for when using long argument format).

	should consider processing '~'-style stuff in '@'-toggle, even tho
	the 'stat()' command would need 'abspath()' processing.

88/09/09:
	in editlink, should permit '%' expressions such as that used in
	'deddoit()'.

88/09/15:
	Using '@' toggle with symbolic links on the last two lines of the
	window, I get a screen-update glitch: apollo vt100 optimizes to
	permit up to 3 lines upward; curses has lost its notion of the
	column.  Should make 'blip()' able to reset curses' position.
	Observed this in ~hofkin, who has links
		spc-gould -> /network/software/u1/hofkin
		src -> /network/mips/src/src1/npsources/src
	which slow the stat down.  '_puts()' is not a simple solution...
