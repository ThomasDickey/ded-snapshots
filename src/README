--(TO-DO)----------------------------------------------------------------------

88/05/10:
	There is a hole: if I resize in ftree, the unsavewin() may
	not work correctly, since we will be restoring to a different size.

88/05/16:
	Don't think that csh-like symbolic links are processed correctly
	(e.g., "~/src").  Probably should modify linkstat (and corresponding
	inline code in ftree) to do a readlink/abspath/stat (on apollo at
	least).

88/09/1:
	For SYSTEM5, should use 'wrefresh(curscr)' to forcibly refresh the
	screen.

88/09/08:
	should consider processing '~'-style stuff in '@'-toggle, even tho
	the 'stat()' command would need 'abspath()' processing.

90/01/11:
	should reduce the number of 'getwd()' and 'abspath()' calls needed
	in the interfaces to 'dedring' and 'ftree'.  this would aid performance.

92/02/28:
	use dynamic strings where buffer-size restrictions occur (e.g., in
	shell-commands).

	allow link to soft-link (actually to the link-target).

92/10/09:
	make directory-rename from ftree apply to the file-lists.

	allow environment-variables to be interpreted in the pathnames in
	ftree jump-commands.

93/11/01:
	modify 'V'-tree command to accept repeat-count; use this to set
	visibility to the given level.

	modify to support Sys5-curses (including keypad stuff).

DED:
	make signals work properly for aborting the scan of long directory

	when ftree's 'R' hits an unreadable directory, allow q/g response.

	save A-flag (hidden files) in .ftree file?

	"o" for options.

	:-commands (cd, version, edit, up/down)

	make all keys rebindable.
	config-file to control edit-keys

	e/E commands

	empty directories

	&-command toggle _all_ hidden files

	allow 'R' command to be interrupted (get partial-scan)

	allow ^R command to read from a pipe.

	allow workspace-viewer in ftree.

	use name-completion from vile.

	make "x" command split window horizontally, combine with commands
	for setting displayable fields as in FLIST.

	in ftree, highlight the current "/" when moving the cursor left/right.

	make ftree's rename-command have command history.

	fix pathname-parsing for things like (in ftree) "~foo/bar"

	make interface for CVS (like rcslast).

	make "o" command (in workspace viewer) for toggling options in
	user-friendly manner.

	make link-substitution allow "%r" and "%e", etc.

	make ^A toggle workspace completely on/off

	make argument on '*' show items within stack.

	make :set shell=FFF, so I can use 'execute()' rather than
	'system()', maybe get rid of problems with signals.

	make a message-table instead of the beeping.
