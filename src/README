  Provide help from within workarea pager.

  Should recognize '~' explicitly in shell-commands,
  and in dedscan-module.

  Do better error diagnostics.

  Make spawned processes inherit options from current one

  Provide for 2-display lists/viewports.

  Correct apollo message about trying to open nil-files

  Use SHELL environment variable & bldargs() so we needn't
  go thru 'system()' call (which always goes thru /bin/sh).

  Integrate 'padedit()' error messages with 'ded'.
