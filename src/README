--(TO-DO)----------------------------------------------------------------------

88/05/03:
	ft_insert does not check for apollo links such as /usr/lib mapping
	to /bsd4.2/usr/lib, since only the /usr part is a link.  This causes
	confusion also in the F,B,E commands.  If I make 'abspath()' translate
	all pathnames via the name_$get_path, this solves that problem at
	the expense of two others: links are resolved, and the code runs
	slower.

88/05/06:
	Repeat count on search (e.g., "/") commands?

88/05/10:
	There is a hole: if I resize in ftree, the unsavewin() may
	not work correctly, since we will be restoring to a different size.

88/05/16:
	Don't think that csh-like symbolic links are processed correctly
	(e.g., "~/src").  Probably should modify linkstat (and corresponding
	inline code in ftree) to do a readlink/abspath/stat (on apollo at
	least).

88/08/09:
	'beep()' and 'blip()' write to stderr, which is not necessarily good.
	Should try to use 'curses' internal routine to send characters.
	I saw beep clobber an escape sequence on the gould.

88/09/1:
	For SYSTEM5, should use 'wrefresh(curscr)' to forcibly refresh the
	screen.

88/09/08:
	should consider processing '~'-style stuff in '@'-toggle, even tho
	the 'stat()' command would need 'abspath()' processing.

88/09/15:
	Using '@' toggle with symbolic links on the last two lines of the
	window, I get a screen-update glitch: apollo vt100 optimizes to
	permit up to 3 lines upward; curses has lost its notion of the
	column.  Should make 'blip()' able to reset curses' position.
	Observed this when cursor is on the last line of the file-list screen.
	('_puts()' is not a simple solution...)

90/01/11:
	should reduce the number of 'getwd()' and 'abspath()' calls needed
	in the interfaces to 'dedring' and 'ftree'.  this would aid performance.

92/02/18:
	if user renames a directory in 'ftree', should check to see if the
	name appeared in any of the filelists and update the corresponding
	entry.
