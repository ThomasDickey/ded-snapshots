To do:
-----
  Provide help from within workarea pager.

  Make spawned processes inherit options from current one

  Use SHELL environment variable & bldargs() so we needn't
  go thru 'system()' call (which always goes thru /bin/sh).

88/05/03:
	ft_insert does not check for apollo links such as /usr/lib mapping
	to /bsd4.2/usr/lib, since only the /usr part is a link.  This causes
	confusion also in the F,B,E commands.  If I make 'abspath()' translate
	all pathnames via the name_$get_path, this solves that problem at
	the expense of two others: links are resolved, and the code runs
	slower.

88/05/06:
	Repeat count on search (e.g., "/") commands?

88/05/10:
	There is a hole: if I resize in ftree, the unsavewin() may
	not work correctly, since we will be restoring to a different size.

	The top_argv checking in 'dedring' does not take into account invocation
	with a wildcard.

88/05/11:
	Should provide a rename-leaf command in ftree using '='

88/05/16:
	Should do better margin trimming in 'ft_show' and 'ded2s()'.

	Don't think that csh-like symbolic links are processed correctly
	(e.g., "~/src").  Probably should modify linkstat (and corresponding
	inline code in ftree) to do a readlink/abspath/stat (on apollo at
	least).

	The 'h' and backspace command in ftree should not be sticky with
	level.

88/05/25:
	Encountered bug (maybe apollo system) which caused vsize-call in
	'resizewin()' to get strange values after toggling +/- commands
	several times, then invoking 'w'.

88/05/26:
	Should add an 'o'/'O' command to create new files in the list so we
	don't have to do a rescan to get them.

88/06/13:
	sometimes the '@' state in ftree is not cleared when we re-read and
	it should now be a directory instead of a link.

88/06/27:
	Should redo the ftree-rename so it renames the ring-entries too.

88/08/09:
	'beep()' and 'blip()' write to stderr, which is not necessarily good.
	should try to use 'curses' internal routine to send characters, or
	write to stderr.  I saw beep clobber an escape sequence on the gould.

88/08/16:
	In ftree, if I do a repeated 'q' or 'Q' command which exceeds the
	number of actual ring-entries, I get a segment violation.

	Also, sometimes the 'R' does not properly quit from the existing
	ring entry when no files are found.

88/08/19:
	The 'U' command should be toggled back in the '=' command (unless I
	decide to permit editing the AEGIS name!).  Also, should consider
	adding a command to edit link text.  Note that for these, I should
	also consider letting 'edittext()' use more than one line...
