--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The regression-test for DED must be run from a terminal which supports curses
(i.e., has cursor addressability).  DED is run from a series of command scripts
which do not alter permanently any of the files in the local tree (consisting
of this test directory, and the corresponding src & bin directories).  It
does assume that they are present, however.

Differences between the command-script and the resulting log-file are reported.
Except for the selection of "RCS" by certain commands, the sed-scripts in this
test should filter out all differences.
